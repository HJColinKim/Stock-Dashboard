The UI needs more work, but at the moment it's enough for basic functionality.

When the user types in an invalid Stock Symbol Name then it will run an error message through a Toast Popup instead of an alert message.


A simple display of all the current data on stocks when the user types in a valid Stock Symbol. A nice and easy way for investors to constantly be up to date with the market!
