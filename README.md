# Stock-Dashboard
A dashboard that stock investors can use to find out details and information about the stocks they are interested in. Utilizes Alpha Vantage API.

The UI needs more work, but at the moment it's enough for basic functionality.

When the user types in an invalid Stock Symbol Name then it will run an error message through a Toast Popup instead of an alert message.


A simple display of all the current data on stocks when the user types in a valid Stock Symbol. A nice and easy way for investors to constantly be up to date with the market!

I've added an AI Agent chatbot from Jotform AI into the website for users to interact with to get help in stock market information and decision-making in the bottom right.
Also makes this website feel more like a personal dashboard that feels more home.

*Note, the AI chatbot still requires a lot more work. Very ineffective as of now in retrieving proper stock information and advising users, would likely require a change in AI model on Jotform
or training the AI bot.
